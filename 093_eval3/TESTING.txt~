(1)Run ./ffosh, and you can see "ffosh$",
   a) you can input command like "/bin/ls", and you can see all the files under this folder and a message "Program was successful" this is correct, because it is full path to the command.
   b) you can input command like "ls", and you can see "Program failed with code 1", this is correct, because it is not a full path to the command.
   c) you can just write "./ffosh < input.txt" and you can see the same answers like a) and b).
